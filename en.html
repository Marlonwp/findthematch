      <h2>About the Band</h2>
      <p>
        Find The Match is an indie alternative band from southern Brazil. The project was born out of friendship and the meeting of different paths that life brought together around music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rodrigo Noro (vocals) comes from a grunge background, with a distinctive and original voice — his raspy, energetic tone adds character to every song.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fabio Heck (guitar) has roots in hardcore, delivering intense riffs and blazing solos that set the sound on fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matteo (bass) also draws from hardcore influences, bringing a technical and precise approach that anchors the groove.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marlon Werner (guitar and drums) is the most cerebral and self-taught member, blending a wide range of influences from classic rock to contemporary alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        After years of changes, breaks, and reunions, the band was reborn in 2024 as Find The Match, with the purpose of creating original English songs and sharing stories with everyone who connects to this energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their first official single, <strong>Live in Peace</strong>, will be released on streaming platforms in August 2025.
